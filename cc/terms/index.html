Coaching Canines reserve the right to change these terms and conditions at any time, with any changes coming into immediate effect. It is the responsibility of clients to read these terms and conditions in full. Please make sure you have read and understood the terms and conditions before you make a booking. By placing a booking you are deemed to have read, understood and agreed to the terms and conditions in full. </p>

            <h2 class="mb-2">Ethics</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Coaching Canines adheres to the Association of Pet Behaviour Counsellors Code of Conduct which means I use scientifically based, modern training methods. Harsh handling is discouraged, with positive reinforcement encouraged instead. All training between trainer and client is confidential. Coaching Canines does not allow the use of any piece of equipment that can cause pain and discomfort for a dog. This includes slip leads, choke chains, pinch collars, shock collars, citronella collars, rattle cans, spray bottles, compressed air canisters, or any other device or method, that could cause harm, pain, suffering or fear for a dog. Any clients who continue to use harsh handling methods will have any sessions cancelled, with no refund given. Coaching Canines reserves the right not to work with any client if the trainer does not wish to, and no reason has to be given. Working with clients is at the discretion of Coaching Canines.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-2">Payments</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">All bookings must be paid for via BANK transfer or CASH. However, 50% of the fee is required at the time of booking as a deposit, and the remaining 50% by the start of the session, either via BANK transfer or CASH, if in person. The booking cannot be confirmed until the deposit has been paid and the session will not go ahead until full payment has been received. By placing a booking, you are deemed to have read and understood these terms. Confirmation of your booking will be sent via email. Clients must ensure they arrive at the correct location, at the agreed time and date. Non-attendance will result in the loss of the payment. Any session paid for must be taken within 6 months of that date. Cancelling a scheduled appointment will result in the loss of the payment unless 48 hours notice is given prior to the session, allowing the session to be rearranged.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">The appointment is for a set time period, which depends on whether a one-to-one session or behaviour consultation has been booked. If the client is late for the session, there is no guarantee that the trainer will be able to extend the session past the agreed time, and the session may have to still finish at this agreed time. If the trainer arrives to an appointment and the client is not there, every effort will be made to make contact with the client. If the client cannot be reached, the trainer will wait for fifteen minutes before leaving. In this circumstance, the client will not receive a refund for the session. Coaching Canines reserve the right to change the timing, date or location of a training sessions in order to best support training, or where reasons beyond our control make it necessary. Sessions will take place at the clients home or preferred training location, as agreed prior to the session.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">Any parking fees or other charges, such as congestion fees, or hiring a secure area, will be paid for by the client. Sessions further than 15 miles from Coaching Canines address will incur a fee of 30p per mile, including the return journey. No refund of the deposit (50% of the total amount) will be given if any session is cancelled, but, at the discretion of Coaching Canines, sessions may be re-scheduled with at least 48 hours notice.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mb-2">Health and Wellbeing</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Your dog's health and wellbeing is paramount to Coaching Canines. Any dogs who are unable to partake in training sessions due to injury or illness should not be involved in any training. Any dogs with infectious disease, such as kennel cough, should not be placed into an environment where this is able to spread to other dogs. If you are unsure of the cause of your dogs symptoms,  a vet must be consulted. Dogs should be vaccinated or have a titre test as evidence of immunity. It is advised that puppies who haven't finished their vaccination course should not walk on the floor outside the training venue, and should be carried to and from the car.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-2">Equipment and Clothing</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Dog training is practical and requires appropriate shoes and clothing. Flat, comfortable shoes are recommended for safety reasons and, as some training requires clients to get down on the ground, suitable and comfortable clothing is recommended.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-2">Insurance</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Coaching Canines has the necessary business insurance to support  the services it provides. We advise our clients adequately insure their dogs, including third party liability insurance.</p>
            
            <h2 class="mb-2">Disclaimer</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Animals can act unpredictably, and may cause injury to people and other animals. Despite engaging in training for reactive or aggressive behaviour, successful control of these behaviours is not guaranteed. Precautions should therefore be taken that may include, keeping your dog on a lead, muzzling, not mixing with other dogs or people, exercising the animal in secure, private areas and making other aware of a dogs behaviour tendencies. Owners are responsible for their animal's behaviour at all times and must ensure they have the correct insurance to cover their pet for liability in the event damage or injury towards a third party.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-2">Photographs and Recordings</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Photographs and/or recordings may be taken by Coaching Canines during training classes or one-to-one sessions for educational and promotional purposes; however, this will always be discussed with clients. Additional photographs and/or recordings may not be taken without prior permission from Coaching Canines.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-2">Health and Safety</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Dog training can be a physical activity and handlers are reminded to take due care and attention to their safety, and the safety of others. Handlers are responsible for their dog’s actions and behaviour at all times. Coaching Canines will make every effort to provide a safe and secure environment for training you dog in. However, as we all know, dogs are animals  and there can be risks associated with training. Any client who participates in training, therefore does so at their own risk. Coaching Canines will not take responsibility for loss, damage or injury to any animals or persons who attend training classes, or any other services provided by Coaching Canines. Coaching Canines does not take responsibility for any loss or damage to a client's property whilst participating in training or any service.</p>
